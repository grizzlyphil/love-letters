	<p>
		Can you please just leave me alone. I know we initialized this relationship but I was drunk and was trying to say get a drink, but I slurred my words and you mistakenly heard git init. Ever since you constantly ask me about our status. Every time I try to change things you add . it all right before you try to get me to commit. You are constantly begging for commitment. Leaving messages every time a commitment is made signed only -m.  You keep a log of every time we meet and of every change I try to make. You try to stash away how these changes affect you in order to prevent further disruption upstream. Lets branch apart, in other words GIT a life!
