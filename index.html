		<p>
			These last few weeks have been absolutely wonderful. You are constantly surprising me and making my life easier. Whether it’s ending processes with cmd+c or helping me to make banners to express my affection. You only echo my love especially when I type echo ‘my love’.
			Whenever I am lost you, there you are with a pwd to tell me what directory I’m in. A simple ls from me and you’re ready to tell me every file in the directory. Our destinies have changed to be with each other and if we ever need we can hop to a new destiny with a new directory simply through cd. Your touch leaves traces of your love in the form of files. If there’s nowhere for us to run to we can mkdir and create our own heaven to escape to. Bash let’s connect to a  server and run away into the sunset. Don’t let me forget what an artist you are, you know how to capture screenshots without a drop shadow everytime I am frustrated with wasted pixels you are there to say “ defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool TRUE “ calming me down.

			Keep me away from the inefficiencies of a world without you and lets be together forever
